Pyhedron - a polyhedron implementation in Python
#################################################

There are a lot if implementations of Polyhedrons out there.
Most of them are implemented in C++ because of efficiency reason.
Sometimes they offer a Python API and maybe a Pip installation package.
But: Because these Packages are implemented in C++,
they are often difficult to install and offer a API that is not very Pythish.

This is wath this implementation should solve:
 * Pyhedron is implemented in pure Python
 * There is a standard Pip installation Package that is easy to install.
 * It only depends on Numpy
